                <h2>Chris Fanucchi</h2>
                <p> Chris is long-time IT professional, with 17 years in the tech industry as a software developer and network engineer. He
                also spent 12 years in the FBI as a Special Agent, where he had an opportunity to gain more experience with

                bringing success to the organization and team. He has always loved programming, since he was in 3rd grade, and has
                experience with multiple computer languages, to include JavaScript, Python and PHP. Chris is currently looking for a
                position in software development as either a software engineer or development team leader. </p>
